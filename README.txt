This is a fork of https://github.com/oriolpich/battenberg (battenberg modify to work with multiple samples), which itself is a fork of the original battenberg.

In this repository, we modify Oriol's multi-sample battenberg version to a) output fractional, unrounded, copy numbers for alleles A and B; b) calculate confidence intervals for this copy numbers
